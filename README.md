# Yelp-Restaurant-Review-Summarization

## Overview

This analysis transforms unstructured restaurant reviews into clear, decision ready insights by identifying customer sentiment, recurring themes, and experience drivers across multiple businesses. Rather than reviewing individual comments, stakeholders can quickly understand what customers consistently value, where experiences fall short, and which areas offer the greatest opportunity for improvement.

Using structured queries and automated text summarization, large volumes of customer feedback are distilled into concise categories covering food quality, service, ambiance, convenience, and pricing

## Background

Online customer reviews contain valuable feedback, but their unstructured format makes large scale analysis difficult. Business leaders often lack the time or tools to read hundreds of individual comments to identify meaningful patterns, sentiments, trends, or operational strengths and weaknesses.

This analysis addresses that challenge by organizing reviews into positive and negative sentiment groups and summarizing them into clear themes and categories. The result is a structured view of customer experience that supports faster, more informed decision making without requiring stakeholders to manually interpret raw review text.

## Data Structure 

This ERD shows how restaurant reviews are linked to businesses and how sentiment summaries are derived from customer feedback. Individual reviews are analyzed to extract recurring themes and sentiments, which are then organized into structured summaries for easier interpretation.
